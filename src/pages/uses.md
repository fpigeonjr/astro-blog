## Code Editor

I have used [ Visual Studio Code ](vscode) for many years as my code editor. These days I am experimenting with [ Zed ](zed) and [ Neovim ](http://www.lazyvim.org/). I am learning Vim this year and am loving the motions and key combos it unlocks. Most IDEs provide Vim support so I can take what I learn with me.

## Terminal

I am using [ Ghostty ](https://ghostty.org/) for my terminal by [ mitchellh ](https://x.com/mitchellh). It is a fast, feature-rich, and cross-platform terminal emulator that uses platform-native UI and GPU acceleration.
